# Physics-Problem-Set-Solutions
A collection of miscellaneous solutions and derivations found in first-year physics. Solutions walk through problem-solving steps and equations used, though algebraic manipulation steps are often skipped. This is in no way a comprehensive study guide, but if you happen to find a specific problem on your own P-set, you may find this github helpful.
